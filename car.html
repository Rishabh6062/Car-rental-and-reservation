            <p style="color: beige;">Though there is an assortment of brand-new and fully redesigned passenger cars hitting the road for 2020 model year, their numbers are dwindling as buyers are instead choosing sport-utility vehicles as their rides of choice. Stalwart sedans like the Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus are being discontinued, with the number of small cars in particular thinning rapidly. While there were 26 subcompact models on the market as recently as 2016, theyâ€™re down to just 17 for 2019, with the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic reportedly bowing out at the end of the current model year.</p>
